            This doesn&#39;t make any sense. Why would he fight someone for milk? Ok.

        <p>
            A-a man is driving his car when his ex-wife calls him.
        </p>
        <p>
            She says: &quot;You have never been there for us, but right now I need your help. Your daughter is at her
            milk competition at school, and she&#39;s run out of milk. For once in your life, please do something and
            help her.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The man decides: &quot;Ok. This is my shot to prove myself to my daughter.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            He goes to the store to buy milk but there&#39;s a crazy lady in the aisle in front of the milk. The man
            starts thinking: &quot;Wha- I don&#39;t have time for this.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;Need to help my daughter.&quot; So he pushes her aside, and he buys her milk.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then he drives straight to his daughter&#39;s school and hands her the milk,

            His daughter freaks out: &quot;You idiot. This is the WRONG milk.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;This is skim milk! My competition is RUINED.&quot; The man did all he could, and in the end it was for
            nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a waste of time and even putting in effort made everyone more upset and angry with him
        </p>
        <p>
            And maybe he should just quit trying! The end!

            Maybe, his daughter is given the milk, and she realizes this is the wrong milk.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is skim milk, his daughter could freak out, but for once in her life her dad is there for her, and he
            profusely apologizes,
        </p>
        <p>
            He did everything wrong, but he tried and he regrets making this mistake. But his daughter is ok
            with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            She goes on stage for the milk competition
        </p>
        <p>
            And she pours the milk on herself. And the judges they see that clearly, she&#39;s pouring skim milk, and
            give her low scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            But she is happy and her dad is happy, because it never really was about the competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was about trust and being able to be there for someone when he needed it the most.
