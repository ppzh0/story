            This doesn&#8217;t make any sense. Why would he fight someone for milk? Ok.

            A-a man is driving his car when his ex-wife calls him.
        </p>
        <p>
            She says: &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;You have never been there for us&comma; but right now I need your help. Your
            daughter is at her milk competition at school&comma; and she&#8217;s run out of milk. For once in your
            life&comma; please do something and help her.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;
        </p>
        <p>
            The man decides: &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Ok. This is my shot to prove myself to my
            daughter.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;
        </p>
        <p>
            He goes to the store to buy milk but there&#8217;s a crazy lady in the aisle in front of the milk. The man
            starts thinking: &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Wha- I don&#8217;t have time for this.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;
        </p>
        <p>
            &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Need to help my daughter.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; So he pushes her aside&comma; and he
            buys her milk.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then he drives straight to his daughter&#8217;s school and hands her the milk&comma;

            His daughter freaks out: &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;You idiot. This is the WRONG milk.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;

        <p>
            &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;This is skim milk! My competition is RUINED.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; The man did all he
            could&comma; and in the end it was for nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a waste of time and even putting in effort made everyone more upset and angry with him
        </p>
        <p>
            And maybe he should just quit trying! The end!

            Maybe&comma; his daughter is given the milk&comma; and she realizes this is the wrong milk.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is skim milk&comma; his daughter could freak out&comma; but for once in her life her dad is there for
            her&comma; and he profusely apologizes&comma;
        </p>
        <p>
            He did everything wrong&comma; but he tried and he regrets making this mistake. But his daughter is ok with
            it.
        </p>
        <p>
            She goes on stage for the milk competition
        </p>
        <p>
            And she pours the milk on herself. And the judges they see that clearly&comma; she&#8217;s pouring skim
            milk&comma; and give her low scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            But she is happy and her dad is happy&comma; because it never really was about the competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was about trust and being able to be there for someone when he needed it the most.
