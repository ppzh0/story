            Hey, everyone. Look who stopped by to say hello.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's Socko.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hey!
        </p>
        <p>
            Where you been, Socko?
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been where I always am when you're not wearing me on your hand. In a frightening, liminal space between states of being. Not quite dead, not quite alive. It's similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Socko, we were just talking about the world and how it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Boy, that sounds complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you have anything you'd want to teach us about the world?
        </p>
        <p>
            I wouldn't say anything that you probably haven't already said yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't know about that, Socko.
        </p>
        <p>
            How about you give it a try?
        </p>
        <p>
            All right.

            That's pretty intense.
        </p>
        <p>
            No shit.
        </p>
        <p>
            What can I do to help?
        </p>
        <p>
            Read a book or something. I don't know. Just don't burden me with the responsibility of educating you. It's incredibly exhausting.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm sorry, Socko. I was just trying to become a better person.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why do you rich fucking white people insist on seeing every socio-political conflict through the myopic lens
            of your own self-actualization? This isn't about you. So either get with it, or get out of the fucking way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Watch your mouth, buddy. Remember <em>who's on whose hand here</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            But that's what I-- Have you not been fucking listening? We are entrenched in--
        </p>
        <p>
            All right. All right.

            Wait! No, please! <br> I don't want to go back.

        <p>
            I can't go... <br> I can't go back.

            Please. Please.

            Are you gonna behave yourself?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, what?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, sir.

            Look at me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, sir.

            That's better.
