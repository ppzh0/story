        <p>
            When shadows creep and dark winds howl&#44;
        </p>
        <p>
            And burdens weigh upon your soul&#44;
        </p>
        <p>
            Take heart&#44; for even nights most grim
        </p>
        <p>
            Shall fade beneath the morning&#8217;s hymn.
        </p>

            The storm may rage&#44; the skies may weep&#44;
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet all must tire and fall to sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            No sorrow clings to life&#8217;s embrace
        </p>
        <p>
            But time shall wear its weary face.

            Think not that this&#44; thy trial&#44; shall reignâ€”

        <p>
            Thy heart is strong&#44; though wrapped in pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            For in thy depths&#44; a spark remains&#44;
        </p>
        <p>
            A quiet flame that hope sustains.

        <p>
            Look yonder&#44; where the dawn unfolds&#44;
        </p>
        <p>
            Its gilded touch on earth so cold.
        </p>
        <p>
            The world awaits thy steps to take&#44;
        </p>
        <p>
            To shape&#44; to bend&#44; to build&#44; to make.

            Oh&#44; tarry not in despair&#8217;s snare&#44;

        <p>
            For even now&#44; sweet life is there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its call&#44; a whisper soft yet true&#44;
        </p>
        <p>
            To rise&#44; to fight&#44; and to renew.

        <p>
            This shadow&#44; too&#44; shall surely pass.
        </p>
        <p>
            And when it does&#44; the light shall show
        </p>
        <p>
            The endless fields where thou shalt go.
