            Hey&#44; Vsauce.

            The title of this video is misspelled <em>in honour of mistakes</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mistakes are everywhere&#44; they surround us like air
        </p>
        <p>
            To err is human.
        </p>
        <p>
            Faults&#44; flaws&#44; faux pas&#44; fumbles and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today as the stuff we&#8217;ve gotten right.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance&#44; if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee&#44; why would there be so many &#8220;k&#8221;s?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well&#44; the &#8220;k&#8221;s are silent by mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
            The original old English forms of these words were pronounced with &#8220;k&#8221; sounds.

        <p>
            But that&#8217;s a bit of a mouthful to say and because reading and writing weren&#8217;t as common hundreds of years ago&#44; people just pronounced words the way they want to do&#44; regardless of spelling.

        <p>
            The amount of time it takes for half of the knowledge within a field to be superseded by new&#44; better ideas or to simply be shown untrue.

            Humans are awesome&#44; don&#8217;t get me wrong&#44; but we tend to believe that what we currently think we know about the universe is reasonably correct&#44; even though statistics aren&#8217;t on our side. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote_mistakes_and_correctness" id="ref-1">[1]</a></sup>

            My favourite examples of the ubiquity of mistakes are production errors in popular songs.

        </p>
        <p>
            Once you hear the mistake&#44; it&#8217;s tough to unhear it.

            Seriously&#44; it&#8217;s in the actual song.

            Take a look at this 700-year-old prayer book.
        </p>
        <p>
            A monk wrote it on fresh&#44; clean paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            I&#8217;m kidding&#44; of course.

            He scraped the ink off an older manuscript&#44; cut the pages and rotated them before writing all over them.
        </p>
        <p>
            A mistake? Well&#44; kind of.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recent multispectral images of the prayer book have revealed that the old manuscript he erased was a previously unknown copy of a work by Archimedes.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was called &#8220;The Method&#8221; and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years before Newton and Leibniz.
        </p>
        <p>
            If that one monk hadn&#8217;t erased that one book&#44; would we be hundreds&#44; thousands of years mathematically and technologically more advanced today than we currently are?

            All that is certain is that we would continue to make ridiculous mistakes&#44; like the Mars Climate Orbiter.

        <p>
            This 327.6 million dollar expedition burned up in the red planet&#8217;s atmosphere because when calculating flight maneuvers&#44; NASA used the agreed-upon metric units while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system.

            Ten years ago Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while hunting outside of San Diego.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hoping to attract the attention of rescuers&#44; he lit a small fire.

            The man carrying a wounded soldier in this painting&#44; based on a photograph taken during World War I&#44; is <a href="https://google.com/search?q=Henry+Tandey+site:wikipedia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Tandey</a>&#44; an English recipient of the Victoria Cross.
        </p>
        <p>
            Four years after the event in this image Tandey caught a wounded German soldier in his gun sights.
        </p>
        <p>
            But rather than kill the man&#44; Tandey took pity on his wounded state and spared his life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The German he allowed to live was this man. Later the man whose life he spared wore his mustache shorter but still had the same name&#44;

        <p>
            Adolf Hitler.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1918 did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill Hitler?
        </p>
        <p>
            Detailed researchers found that the exact days their units were in the same location don&#8217;t quite match up.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story is apocryphal but what is known is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting of Tandey&#44; and in 1938&#44; when meeting with Neville Chamberlain&#44;
        </p>
        <p>
            Hitler pointed to Tandey and told Chamberlain:

            Over time&#44; the scar&#44; the carving won&#8217;t go away.

        <p>
            Because of the way trees grow it won&#8217;t go up or down much either&#44; it&#8217;ll just stay right where it began.

            It might even get darker. But it won&#8217;t get bigger.

            A red or purple leaf in the autumn.
        </p>
        <p>
            As days get shorter and chlorophyll production decreases&#44; the yellow and orange carotenoids&#44; which are always in leaves&#44; appear as the green fades.
        </p>
        <p>
            But red and purple leaves are the interesting ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            As winter approaches it would seem to be a good time for trees to conserve energy but some trees do the opposite. Instead of giving up&#44; they spend extra energy producing anthocyanins to turn their leaves red and purple hues.
        </p>
        <p>
            These colours protect their leaves from sun damage before their nutrients can all be used and may also be a defence against insects looking for a parasitic home.
        </p>
        <p>
            A way for the tree to tell the insects: &#8220;<em>Yes&#44; I am in part dying but not without a fight. I am still very much vital.</em>&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Drought and even turn a kit applied by man can bring about these colors prematurely.

            When you look at beautiful autumn colours&#44; you are looking at stress.

        <p>
            But the bigger the fight the trees put up&#44; the more energy they put into their defences at the very end&#44; the more brilliant their colours will be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Winter will eventually come.
        </p>
        <p>
            But scientifically&#44; the brightest&#44; deepest&#44; most remarkable colours come from not giving up too easily or quickly. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote_authors_note" id="ref-4">[i]</a></sup>
