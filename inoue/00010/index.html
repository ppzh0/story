        <p>Well, that's it! All I have to do is repeat the same steps, everyone loves a good sequel</p>
        <p>... no matter how late</p>
        <br>
        <p>Actually, a man goes to the store except this time he buys yogurt and he has a mustache now,</p>
        <p>that's character development.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>Why do I get the feeling this is terrible?</p>
        <p>I mean, everyone loved this, they want more of this, this should be easy!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Okay, a man goes to the store, he buys some...</p>
        <p>he buys cheese</p>
        <p>he buys cream</p>
        <p>he buys...</p>
        <p>A man goes to the store to buy some milk...</p>
        <p>... Multiverse!</p>
        <p>That's right, all of the men are here!</p>
        <p>And they're here to buy everything!</p>
        <br>
        <p>You know what, maybe sequels are terrible. No one likes them. This is a horrible idea.</p>

        <p>"We've seen you here before, man! How much milk do you need?!"</p>
        <p>"Get the hell out of here! No one needs this much milk!"</p>

        <p>Okay, I got it, higher stakes, right?</p>

        <br>
        <p>Right now your daughter is going to the qualifications for the Milk Olympics,</p>
        <p>and she has all of the milk she needs right here, with me!</p>
        <p>It's whole, it's organic!</p>
        <p>She's about to get the highest scores, and it's not thanks to you!</p>
        <p>In fact, she probably would have been </p>
        <p>even better now if you hadn't gotten her that skim milk...!</p>
