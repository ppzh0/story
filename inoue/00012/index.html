    <blockquote>
        <p>Once there was a girl named Frida </p>
        <p>who lived her life carefree</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Until one day</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>She looked in a mirror </p>
        <p>perhaps a bit too closely</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Her teeth seemed so large and</p>
        <p>her nose so awfully big</p>
        <p>her lips were too thin</p>
        <p>and her hair split like a wig</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Is this how I've always been?" </p>
        <p>she couldn't help but say</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>So she told herself, </p>
        <p>"I guess I'm not pretty" </p>
        <p>and she kept thinking that way</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Over the years in her day-to-day </p>
        <p>she tried not to care</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>but often with friends, she could only think, </p>
        <p>"I really don't belong here"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>So one day to her closest friend </p>
        <p>she finally consoled</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I know I'm not pretty but from you I want the truth told"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Her friend seemed a bit puzzled</p>
        <p>"You look normal as far as I'm aware"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"But maybe you look so closely,</p>
        <p>you don't know is there?"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>So Frida looked in the mirror </p>
        <p>and she saw what she did as usual</p>

        <p>then she took some steps back</p>

        <p>though it seemed a bit delusional</p>

        <p>But how a mirror can skew your vision</p>

        <p>she had never quite understood</p>

        <p>and with a further away perspective she looked as</p>

        <p>pretty as she... could</p>

        <p>an arm's length away</p>
        <p>she could see herself clearly</p>

        <p>simply given space</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>because a stranger would</p>
        <p>never come up closely and just stare at you in the face</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>and though she still didn't like it </p>
        <p>she thought she had a big ugly nose</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>she had other features she felt were pretty</p>
        <p>and that she did not oppose</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>she wanted her face to be perfect and</p>
        <p>maybe it was a bit silly to think so</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>because a perfect face cannot exist even</p>
        <p>with all the surgery you could throw</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>so to measure herself as not perfect was</p>
        <p>all in all pretty good</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>and to think anything below perfect is awful</p>
        <p>was what she had to misunderstood</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Pretty or not pretty, </p>
        <p>it takes a lot for things to work</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Pretty do not pretty, </p>
        <p>does not come out of focusing on a single quirk</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Pretty or not pretty, </p>
        <p>though wanting to be pretty is not wrong</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Pretty or not pretty</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Was not how she wanted to value herself,</p>
        <p>her whole life long</p>
    </blockquote>
