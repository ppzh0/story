            When I was a child&comma; I had a play of evil and good every time I wear clothe.
        </p>
        <p>
            T-Shirts to be specific. The ones with no buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
            When wearing them&comma; you have to crawl into it; like crawling under a table. &ast;crawling up
        </p>
        <p>
            The evil wants to wear the shirt on flip side; like front and back. It wants to wear it on the backside.
        </p>
        <p>
            The evil was tricked every time&comma; of course.

        <p>
            It was always the evil who lost.
        </p>
        <p>
            The strange thing is that the good never show up but the evil tricks itself every time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I- I never let it winâ€¦ the evil never knows it was being tricked.
        </p>
