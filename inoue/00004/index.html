    <blockquote>
        <p>If you can keep your head when all about you</p>
        <p>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;</p>
        <p>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</p>
        <p>But make allowance for their doubting too:</p>
        <p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</p>
        <p>Or being lied about, don&CloseCurlyQuote;t deal in lies,</p>
        <p>Or being hated, don&CloseCurlyQuote;t give way to hating,</p>
        <p>And yet don&CloseCurlyQuote;t look too good, nor talk too wise;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you can dream&horbar;and not make dreams your master;</p>
        <p>If you can think&horbar;and not make thoughts your aim,</p>
        <p>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster</p>
        <p>And treat those two impostors just the same:</p>
        <p>If you can bear to hear the truth you&CloseCurlyQuote;ve spoken</p>
        <p>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools</p>
        <p>Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,</p>
        <p>And stoop and build &OpenCurlyQuote;em up with worn-out tools;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings</p>
        <p>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</p>
        <p>And lose, and start again at your beginnings</p>
        <p>And never breathe a word about your loss:</p>
        <p>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</p>
        <p>To serve your turn long after they are gone,</p>
        <p>And so hold on when there is nothing in you</p>
        <p>Except the Will which says to them: &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Hold on&excl;&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</p>
        <p>Or walk with Kings&horbar;nor lose the common touch,</p>
        <p>If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</p>
        <p>If all men count with you, but none too much:</p>
        <p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute</p>
        <p>With sixty seconds&CloseCurlyQuote; worth of distance run,</p>
        <p>Yours is the Earth and everything that&CloseCurlyQuote;s in it,</p>
        <p>And&horbar;which is more&horbar;you&CloseCurlyQuote;ll be a Man, my son&excl;</p>
