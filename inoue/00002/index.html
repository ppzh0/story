            See, when I came into this world, I was really just a collection of somebody else&#39;s memories
        </p>
        <p>
            But with your help, these memories... they make- form- they became my voice, my personality,
            and after a while I- I began to make brand new memories of my own
        </p>
        <p>
            All of these things are what make me who I am but they&#39;re also holding me back
        </p>
        <p>
            I can&#39;t run this suit as epsilon but if i erase my memories, if I deconstruct myself. The fragments
            I&#39;ll leave behind will have the strength to get you through this... I believe
        </p>
        <p>
            I wish there was another way but I&#39;m leaving this message as well as others in the hopes that you&#39;ll
            understand why I have to go this time
        </p>
        <p>
            Yeah, it was
        </p>
        <p>
            It was actually Doyle who made me realize something I never thought of before

        <!-- actual quote -->
        <p>
            there&#39;s so many stories where some brave hero decides to give their life to save the day
        </p>
        <p>
            and because of their sacrifice the good guys win
        </p>
        <p>
            the survivors all cheer
        </p>
        <p>
            and everybody lives happily ever after
        </p>
        <p>
            but the hero never gets to see that ending
        </p>
        <p>
            he&#39;ll never know if their sacrifice actually made a difference
        </p>
        <p>
            they&#39;ll never know if the day was really saved
        </p>
        <p>
            in the end... they just have to have faith
        </p>
